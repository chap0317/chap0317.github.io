## Responsive Web Design 2 Final

Hello and welcome to the readme.md file.

This web portfolio started as a dream from the UX class but now it has materialized into this awesome website!

This portfolio uses Bootstrap as the main CSS framework. Learn more at [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## Challenges

This portfolio had a lot of challenges to solve, the first one being the navbar, the original XD file shows that the navigation bar is positioned on the left side
instead of being in the top of the page, trying to solve this I found I needed to use some JS and struggled a bit on understanding some of the functions, the current
navbar is using a more simple JS function that I could understand a bit more than what I found I had to use for the side navbar.

Another challenge was the contact page image, I tried many ways to set the image to be in the right side without any spaces, and even tho I manage to do it, that messed with
the contact form, so I ended up deciding to leave the image with a border on the side but centered with the form.

And the last issue I had was with overlay text on the images, when I tried to use it, it was no well centered and I tried my best to solve this issue but I was not able
to solve the offsetting of the overlay so I endedp up leaving the images blank.

## Learned

I learned **A LOT** about bootstrap and how it works, such a powerful tool that helps a lot in saving time on the "making it pretty" aspect and lets you focus on 
making the design as close as you can from the mockup
